## Features to contribute

There are a lot of missing features that can be added, let's focus on most interesting:

- Full offline support with service workers
- Dark theme support (automatically detected from user os)
- New application â€“ e.g. gradient generator

If you decide to build one of these features please be aware of design language of the app and recreate it as similar as possible for new design elements. Please use eslint and prettier during development. **Make sure you do not have eslint errors before submitting pull request.** You can check that by running `npm run lint` script.
